To setup the project download the zip file and extract it.
In the command prompt type "npm install" to install all the node modules.

Create an .env file because there are two secret keys used here MONGO_URL and JWT_SEC . MONGO_URL key must be your mongodb database connection string and JWT_SEC can be any random string of your choice .

After all these steps enter the command "npm start" the backend server will start and database connection will be established.
